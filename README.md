# 40-Day Python, Machine Learning, Computer Vision & React Roadmap

This repository documents a 40-day intensive, self-directed learning program focused on building strong foundations in:

- Python programming
- Data science and machine learning
- Computer vision
- React-based web development

The goal of this roadmap is not just to follow tutorials, but to build real projects, document growth, and develop professional engineering habits.

Each folder in this repository represents a major technical area with daily progress, experiments, and projects.
