# Python Foundations

This folder contains my work building Python fluency from the ground up.

Focus areas include:
- Core Python syntax and control flow
- Writing clean, readable functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Algorithmic thinking and problem solving

Each subfolder represents a focused topic area, with daily exercises and small projects written from scratch.
